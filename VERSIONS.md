# AetherPet Versions  🐾

*AetherPet* is a terminal-based Java Tamagotchi simulator built as a long-term portfolio project during a Bachelor’s and Master’s CS program. It starts as a simple command-line pet with ASCII art and basic stat tracking — and will evolve into a complex, intelligent digital lifeform.
